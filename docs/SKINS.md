# Writing a Phyzo skin

A skin is the plugin window: an RmlUi document (RML, RCSS, Lua and images) that draws the front panel and binds
it to the synth. Skins are not part of this repository; each lives in its own folder on your Mac:

    ~/Documents/Phyzo/skins/<name>/<name>.rml      (plus its .rcss, .lua, images and fonts)

Every folder in `~/Documents/Phyzo/skins/` that contains `<folder name>.rml` is a skin and appears in the
right-click menu under **Skin**. The compiled-in skin **Built-in** is always there too.

RmlUi's own documentation covers RML and RCSS: https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/. This page describes only what
Phyzo adds.

## Files

- `href` and `src` are plain file names inside the skin folder (`rack.rcss`, `knob.png`). Sub-folders and paths
  outside the folder are refused (the refusal is logged).
- Images: PNG, JPEG or GIF.
- Fonts: every `.ttf` and `.otf` file in the skin folder is loaded when the skin loads. Use the font's family
  name in `font-family`.
- Scripts: `<script src="rack.lua"></script>` or inline `<script>`.

## Size and zoom

The document body is **1795 × 848 dp**. One dp is zoom × display scale physical pixels: at 100 % zoom on a Retina
screen 1 dp = 2 px, so art drawn at twice the dp size (`resolution: 2x` in a `@spritesheet`) stays sharp. The
window size is the body size × zoom: 50-200 %, set by dragging the window's corner or from the right-click menu
(75, 100, 125, 150, 200 %). The dp ratio follows the window continuously; RmlUi redraws the art at each size (no
bitmap stretching of the window). The bottom-right corner (24 screen points) is the resize grip: keep controls out of it.

## Panel elements

### `<knob cc="N">`

An analog panel control (cc 0-25, see `phyzo-emu/docs/PANEL_CONTROLS.md`).

- RCSS properties: `frames: 61;` (number of frames) and `spriteprefix: knob_;`. The knob shows the sprite
  `<spriteprefix><NNN>` with NNN the three-digit frame number (`knob_000` … `knob_060`), through its `decorator`.
- Value: raw 0-1023. Frame = round(raw × (frames − 1) / 1023).
- Mouse: vertical drag (up = more; full range over 256 dp; Shift = a tenth as fast); mouse wheel (16 per notch,
  Shift: 1).
- It sends one panel message `Bx cc vv` (the absolute raw value) only when it is moved, never on its own.
- Several knobs may share a cc (stacked knobs, e.g. one per Envelope / Modulation / Filter page). Each knob element
  keeps its own position, stored by its `id` in the project. Give every knob a unique `id`. A knob seen for the
  first time starts at the value last sent for its cc (the synth's fresh positions in a new instance).
- When the synth boots it is told, for each cc, the value last sent for that cc.

### `<pbutton raw="0xNN" led="0xNN">`

A front-panel button by its panel id. `led` is optional.

- Left mouse button down sends `81 raw`, release sends `80 raw` (also when released outside the button). Class
  `pressed` while down.
- Alt/Option-click: latching hold. It sends `81 raw` and keeps the button held (class `held`) until it is
  clicked again. Esc releases all held buttons.
- Right-click never presses (it opens the menu).
- With `led`: class `lit` follows that LED (see LEDs).

### `<led code="0xNN">` and `<led source="audioclip">`

Class `lit` follows the LED. `audioclip` is the Input Clip LED; it stays unlit until the audio input is added.

### `<vfdigit pos="0..3">`

One display digit: pos 0 is the leftmost (panel message 96), pos 3 the rightmost (93). RCSS property
`spriteprefix: vfd_;`. The element shows the sprite `<spriteprefix><NNN>` with NNN = the OS's segment byte & 0x7F
(three digits, `vfd_000` … `vfd_127`). Segment bits 0-6: g (middle), c, b, a (top), f, e, d (bottom).

### LEDs

The synth's OS sets each LED with a panel message: `91 code` on, `90 code` off, `92 code` flash, `9D code rate` beat
flash. Class `lit` is set:

| OS state | `lit` |
|---|---|
| on | always |
| off | never |
| flash | blinking at 2.5 Hz, 50 % duty; all flashing LEDs in step |
| beat flash | for min(100 ms, half the time since the previous `9D` for that LED), restarted by each `9D` |

(The flash and beat timings are assumptions, kept as named constants in `plugin/skin/src/skin_view.h`.)

## Lua

Scripts run in Lua 5.4 with the base (without `dofile` and `loadfile`; `load` accepts text only), coroutine,
table, string, math and utf8 libraries; no file, OS or debug access. Any single entry into Lua (an event handler,
a callback, a frame) may run for at most 3 seconds and is then stopped. Errors never stop the plugin; they are
written to the skin log.

Each skin window has its own global variables; two Phyzo instances never see each other's.

### `panel`

| Function | Does |
|---|---|
| `panel.led(code)` | 0 off, 1 on, 2 flash (beat flash counts as flash) |
| `panel.onLed(code, fn(state))` | calls `fn` when the LED's state (0/1/2) changes |
| `panel.onBeat(code, fn())` | calls `fn` on every beat-flash message for the LED |
| `panel.knob(cc)` | the value last sent for the cc (0-1023) |
| `panel.setKnob(cc, raw)` | sends the value and moves the visible knob(s) of that cc |
| `panel.onKnob(cc, fn(raw))` | calls `fn` whenever a value is sent for the cc (mouse or Lua) |
| `panel.press(raw)`, `panel.release(raw)` | button down / up (`81 raw` / `80 raw`) |
| `panel.isHeld(raw)` | true while the button is latched (Alt-click) |
| `panel.onButton(raw, fn(down))` | calls `fn` for every press and release: mouse, latching hold and Lua |
| `panel.display()` | the four segment bytes, leftmost first |
| `panel.onDisplay(fn(b0, b1, b2, b3))` | calls `fn` when the display changes (and once when the skin loads) |

### `plugin`

`plugin.name` ("Phyzo"), `plugin.vendor` ("DHammers"), `plugin.version` (e.g. "0.4.0").

### Document events and RmlUi's Lua API

- `<body onload="...">` runs once the document is loaded; `<body onframe="...">` runs every displayed frame, at most
  60 times a second; any element with `onshow="..."` gets a `show` event when the skin is shown.
- Inline event code receives `event`, `element` and `document`. Pass `document` on if a function in a script file
  needs it: `<body onload="onLoad(document)">`.
- RmlUi's Lua API is available (`document:GetElementById`, `element:SetClass`, `element.inner_rml`, …), and
  `Log.Message(Log.logtype.info, "text")` writes to the skin log.

Example: stacked knobs that follow the page LEDs.

```lua
local pages = { [0x20] = "env", [0x21] = "mod", [0x22] = "flt" }   -- LED code -> knob id suffix

function showPage(doc)
  for code, page in pairs(pages) do
    doc:GetElementById("cutoff_" .. page):SetClass("hidden", panel.led(code) == 0)
  end
end

function onLoad(doc)
  for code in pairs(pages) do panel.onLed(code, function() showPage(doc) end) end
  showPage(doc)
end
```

## Working on a skin

- **F5** (with the plugin window focused) or **Reload skin** in the right-click menu reloads the skin from disk;
  knob positions are kept.
- **Developer > RmlUi debugger** shows RmlUi's element inspector and event log.
- The skin log is `~/Documents/Phyzo/skin-log.txt`: warnings (missing files, CSS problems), Lua errors with their
  traceback, and `Log.Message` output.
- If a skin is missing or cannot be loaded, the plugin shows "rack" instead (then Built-in) and says why.

## Testing without a skin

`plugin/skin/tests/skins/test/` is a tiny text-only skin (coloured boxes, no images) that uses every element and
the Lua API; `plugin/skin/tests/skin_test.cpp` drives it in CI. Never commit skins, images or fonts: CI rejects them.
