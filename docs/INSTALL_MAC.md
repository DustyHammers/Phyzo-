# Installing a Phyzo build on your Mac

Every push to `main` and every pull request builds the plugin on GitHub Actions (Apple Silicon, VST3 and AU,
ad-hoc signed). This guide takes you from that build to Phyzo loaded in REAPER.

## 1. Download the build from GitHub

You must be signed in to GitHub to download builds.

1. Open https://github.com/DustyHammers/Phyzo-/actions
2. In the left column, click **CI**.
3. Click the newest run with a green tick for the branch you want: `main` for merged work, or the pull request
   you are testing (its title is shown on the run).
4. On the run's page, scroll down to **Artifacts** and click the file named like
   `Phyzo-0.4.0-macOS-1a2b3c4.zip`. The last part is the commit it was built from.

From a pull request page you can also get there with the **Checks** tab, then **CI** on the left, then **Summary**.

Builds are kept for 30 days. If the newest run has a red cross, its plugin was not built; use an older green run.

## 2. Unzip

Double-click the zip in your Downloads folder (Safari may already have unzipped it). You get a folder containing
`Phyzo.vst3`, `Phyzo.component` and `INSTALL.txt`.

## 3. Install

1. Quit REAPER.
2. In Finder, choose **Go > Go to Folder…** (Shift-Command-G), paste `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3` and press Return.
   If Finder says the folder does not exist, go to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins` instead and create a folder named `VST3`.
3. Drag `Phyzo.vst3` into it. If an older Phyzo is there, choose **Replace**.
4. Do the same for `Phyzo.component` with the folder `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`.

## 4. Clear the quarantine flag

macOS marks everything downloaded from the internet as "quarantined" and refuses to load plugins that are not
notarised by Apple. Phyzo is ad-hoc signed, not notarised, so the mark must be removed:

1. Open **Terminal** (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
2. Type the following, **ending with a space**, and do not press Return yet:

       sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine 

3. Drag **Phyzo.vst3** from Finder onto the Terminal window. Terminal adds its exact location, whichever Library
   folder it is in. Press Return and type your Mac password if asked (nothing shows while you type).
   No message means it worked.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for **Phyzo.component** if you installed the AU.
5. For the AU only: paste this line and press Return, so macOS re-reads its Audio Unit list
   ("No matching processes" is fine):

       killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar

If Terminal prints "Not enough arguments for option -d", the space before the file location is missing.
If it prints "No such file", the path is wrong: drag the plugin onto Terminal instead of typing it.

Plugins work from either `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/...` (your user folder) or `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/...` (all
users); Finder's Go to Folder can land in either.

Repeat step 4 every time you install a new build.

## 5. Load it in REAPER

1. Start REAPER. It scans new plugins at start-up.
2. Insert a track, click its **FX** button and type `Phyzo` in the filter box. You should see
   **VST3i: Phyzo (DHammers)** and an **AUi** entry for Phyzo.
3. If Phyzo is missing: **REAPER > Settings… > Plug-ins > VST**, click **Re-scan** (or **Clear cache/re-scan**), and
   restart REAPER. For the AU, check **Plug-ins > AU** is enabled.

If REAPER reports that the plugin failed to load, repeat step 4 and restart REAPER.

## 6. Put your ROM files in place

Phyzo looks for its two ROM files in one fixed folder: **Documents > Phyzo > roms**
(`/Users/<you>/Documents/Phyzo/roms/`). The plugin creates the folder the first time it opens. Copy the OS image and
the native wave image into it. File names do not matter: each file is recognised by its checksum. While a file is
missing, the plugin window says which one and checks the folder again every two seconds, so the synth starts by
itself a moment after you copy the files in; there is no need to reload the plugin.

## 7. Skins

The plugin window shows a **skin**. Your skins live in **Documents > Phyzo > skins**, one folder per skin: the
folder `rack` with `rack.rml` in it is the skin "rack" (with its .rcss, .lua, images and fonts). The compiled-in skin
**Built-in** is always available. Phyzo starts with "rack" if it is there, otherwise with Built-in.

Right-click anywhere in the window for the menu (the same in every skin):

- **Skin**: Built-in, then every skin in your skins folder (the current one is ticked).
- **Reload skin** (or press **F5** with the window focused): reads the skin again from disk after you edit it.
- **Zoom**: 75, 100, 125, 150 or 200 %. You can also drag the window's bottom-right corner (the small grip) to any
  size from 50 to 200 %; the skin keeps its proportions and stays sharp at every size.
- **Developer > RmlUi debugger**: RmlUi's inspector, for working on a skin.

The skin is a global setting (every Phyzo window and project). The window size is remembered twice: globally, for
new instances, and in each project, so a project reopens at the size it was saved with.
If the chosen skin is missing or cannot be loaded, Phyzo shows "rack" instead (then Built-in) with a message saying
why. Skin messages and script errors are written to `~/Documents/Phyzo/skin-log.txt`. How to write a skin:
`docs/SKINS.md` in the repository.

In a skin: drag a knob up or down (hold Shift for fine steps) or use the mouse wheel; click a button to press it;
**Alt/Option-click** a button to latch it held until you click it again; **Esc** releases all latched buttons.
Right-click never presses anything. Knob positions are part of the synth's panel and are saved with the project.

The **Built-in** skin shows:

- The synth's 4-character display, drawn from the OS's segment data.
- **◀ −** and **+ ▶**: the synth's own −/No and +/Yes buttons; on the preset display they step to the previous or
  next preset. Holding one repeats, as on the hardware.
- **Status**: running, with the host sample rate, or a plain-language message if something stopped. While a ROM
  file is missing (or has the wrong checksum) it says which one and where to put it.
- **Debug**: CPU use per audio block (average and peak over the last second, one bar per second), the block size and
  length, the last block's processing time, and **overruns** (blocks that took longer than their real-time budget;
  any overrun can be heard as a dropout). The third line: the **worst block** time and the longest **audio lock
  wait** since playback started, and how many times the host asked for the plugin's **state** (REAPER does this
  after clicks in a plugin window). These reset when the host restarts audio. The fourth line splits the CPU use per block by part, as
  average/peak percent of the block's real-time budget over the last second: **68k+dev** (the synth's CPU running its
  OS, with timers, serial ports and DMA), **voice** (voice chip), **ESP2** (effects chip), **rate** (conversion from
  44.1 kHz to the host rate) and **queue** (passing knob, button and MIDI events to the synth).

Play Phyzo from a MIDI track. Everything the synth does (including the selected preset, any edits made over
MIDI and the knob positions) is saved with the REAPER project and restored when you open it.

## Uninstalling

Quit REAPER and move `Phyzo.vst3` and `Phyzo.component` (in `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/...` or
`/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/...`) to the Bin.
