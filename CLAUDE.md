# Phyzo: rules for working in this repository

Phyzo is a VST3/AU plugin for personal use that runs a 1998 hardware synthesizer's original OS on emulated hardware
(`phyzo-emu/`). The OS provides all synth behaviour; our code is the hardware. The owner has no local build machine:
GitHub Actions builds everything, and the owner tests the plugin in REAPER on an Apple Silicon Mac. Guide the
owner step by step through anything they must do by hand on github.com or on the Mac.

## Rules (from the owner; do not relax them)

1. **Never commit ROM files or other proprietary data**: no OS image, wave data, tables, recordings, renders,
   trace output or SysEx dumps. CI rejects .bin/.img/.wav/.mid/.syx/.mp3 files and any file over 1 MB.
2. **No synth parameters added or removed** without the owner's explicit instruction.
3. **Mockup before any UI.** Show a mockup and wait for approval before building any user interface.
4. **Stop after each phase**: summarise what changed and say what to test.
5. **THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md** (`phyzo-emu/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`): never change its existing entries. Complete the
   "Planned dependencies" entry for each dependency (full licence text and version) when it is added.
6. **Identify ROMs by checksum, never by file name** (`phyzo-emu/src/rom_id.*`):
   OS image MD5 `8de06f48bfb0d847cacab05b763e22c5`, native wave image MD5 `42a974e31e48b05815d07554d0063171`.
7. **Never commit skins, images or fonts.** Skins live in `~/Documents/Phyzo/skins/<name>/` on the owner's Mac; the
   repo has only the skin engine and the text-only test skin (`plugin/skin/tests/skins/`). CI rejects image and font
   files and .rml/.rcss files outside the test skin. Gearmulator's skinning and Lua docs are a design reference
   only: write our own code.

## Naming and identity

- No product or maker names of the original instrument outside THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md. Deliberately kept names are
  listed in PACKAGE_CONTENTS.md. Chip part numbers MC68340, ES5506 and ESP2 stay. Say "table sweep", not the
  original technique's brand-like name.
- The five realtime performance knobs are named by function in code: perf1 (System Controller 3, effect modulation),
  perf2 (table-sweep position, CC 71), perf3 (filter cutoff, CC 74), perf4 (detune, CC 79), perf5
  (System Controller 4). Visible labels come from the skin.
- Keep the MIDI/SysEx identity (manufacturer code, model number, message formats) exactly as the OS uses it.
- Plugin identity, fixed forever (hosts use it to find the plugin in saved projects): manufacturer "DHammers",
  manufacturer code "DHmr", plugin name "Phyzo", plugin code "Phyz", bundle ID com.dhammers.phyzo, plus
  `JUCE_VST3_CAN_REPLACE_VST2=0`. Resulting VST3 class ID `ABCDEF019182FAEB44486D725068797A`, AU `aumu Phyz DHmr`.
  CI checks all of these (`scripts/check_plugin_identity.py`).

## Other constraints

- No CI job may ever need the ROM files.
- Do not copy Gearmulator code (GPL-3); using its design as a reference is fine.
- Speed work must keep the emulator's output byte-identical to the current version.

## Build and CI

- Dependencies are pinned in `scripts/deps.env` and fetched by `scripts/fetch_deps.sh` into `work/deps/` (ignored).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: data-file guard over every commit (`scripts/check_no_data.py`), ROM-free tests on
  Linux (`ctest` in `phyzo-emu` and `tools/rombuilder`), and the macOS plugin build with identity check, auval and
  the downloadable zip. The ESP2 and voice-core tests hold golden hashes of the current output: a speed change
  that alters them has changed the sound.
- Owner's install guide: `docs/INSTALL_MAC.md`.
- Plugin architecture: `phyzo-emu/src/engine.*` (no JUCE) runs the machine per host block, boots/restores on a worker
  thread, delivers MIDI sample-accurately with a constant reported latency, and converts 44.1 kHz to the host rate
  (`resampler.*`). `plugin/` wraps it (JUCE) and scans `~/Documents/Phyzo/roms/`. Musashi has one global CPU:
  machines take turns on it per 68k slice under a lock (`Machine::becomeCpuOwner`); each machine's devices (timers,
  serial, voice chip, ESP2) run outside the lock, in parallel across instances. Project state = complete machine state
  (`Machine::saveState`), tied to the ROM checksums.
- Skins: `plugin/skin/` (no JUCE) is the runtime: RmlUi 6.3 + Lua 5.4 (sandboxed, 3 s limit) + FreeType, the custom
  elements knob/pbutton/led/vfdigit and the `panel`/`plugin` Lua API; `skin_test` drives the test skin in CI.
  `plugin/Source/RmlSkinComponent.*` draws a file skin with OpenGL (all RmlUi/Lua work on the GL thread);
  `PluginEditor.*` has the Built-in skin, the right-click menu, zoom and the fallback (rack, then Built-in).
  Skin authoring guide: `docs/SKINS.md`. The skin is a global setting; the window scale (50-200 % of the skin's base size,
  aspect locked, resized by our own corner drag) is saved globally and per project; neither is a parameter.
  Per-element knob positions and the window scale are project state (processor state version 3).
- Real-time rules for `engine.*`: the audio thread never waits on other threads. `getState` asks the audio thread
  for a snapshot at a block boundary (`Machine::saveStateInto`, preallocated); panel controls go through a
  lock-free latest-value slot per cc, sent at most once per 10 ms each and only while the panel link keeps up;
  buttons go through a lock-free ring and are never merged or dropped. `phyzo_stress` measures this.
- Panel analog controls (26, `Bx cc vv`, raw 0-1023): `phyzo-emu/docs/PANEL_CONTROLS.md`. Their positions are the
  panel's physical state (`PanelModel::controls`, saved with the machine), never host parameters. The pitch wheel
  must be answered at 512 to the OS's F4 request.
